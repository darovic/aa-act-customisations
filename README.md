# ACT Customisations
A few customisations to Cactbot's raidboss alerts and timelines. Changes include colours, font face, bar and alert sizes.

Warnings are larger and have a translucent background to make them more easily noticable. Timelines are taller, wider, and brigther.

A custom font is used, which is optional.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/darovic/aa-act-customisations/wiki/Installation-instructions) for installation instructions.
